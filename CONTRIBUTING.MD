## 📌 Before You Start

- Go through the **README.md** to understand the project.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Contribute

### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository
- Fork the **SpaceChat** repository to your GitHub account.

  ```
- Navigate to the project directory:

---

### 4️⃣ Commit Your Changes
Write meaningful commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix: <short description of change>"
```

---

### 5️⃣ Open a Pull Request (PR) ✅

Once you’re confident with your implementation:

- Push your changes to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/<short-description>
  ```
- Open a PR from your fork to the **main SpaceChat repository**.

#### 🔴 Mandatory PR Rules
Failure to follow these **WILL result in points not being awarded**, even if the PR is merged.

- ✅ You **must fork** the repo before contributing.
- ✅ Ensure there are **no merge conflicts**.
- ✅ PR title must be **clear and relevant**.
- ✅ The **first line of the PR description MUST contain**:
  ```
  Issue : #<issue_number>

### 🤖 PR Validation Bot
- If your PR follows the template correctly, you’ll receive a **“Valid PR”** message from our GitHub bot.
- If the PR is **invalid**, the bot will warn you and request changes.
- Modify the **same PR** to fix issues — **do NOT close and open a new PR** unless a mentor asks you to.

---

### 🔁 Making Changes After Review
- If a mentor requests changes:
  - Update your code in the **same PR**.
  - Push additional commits to that PR.
- Closing and reopening PRs without permission may lead to **confusion** for you and maintaner.
